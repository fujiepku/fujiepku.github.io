I was trained as a computational physicist. I am interested in applying theoretical numerical calculation to solve the physical/chemical problems, and focus on using the molecular dynamics simulation techniques, ab initio calculation method together with experimental spectroscopies, such as sum frequency generation spectroscopy (SFG) and X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) to understand the structures and dynamics of liquid−solid and liquid−air interfaces, liquid water, ice and hydrogen-bonded organic materials, etc.
Currently, I am working on the excited states related spectroscopic calculations of water.
