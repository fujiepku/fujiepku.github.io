I was trained as a computational physicist and have a strong interest in applying theoretical and numerical methods to solve complex physical and chemical problems. 

My group work focuses on utilizing molecular dynamics simulations and ab initio calculations, combined with multimodal spectroscopies such as **vibrational spectroscopy (IR, Raman, SFG)**, **excited-state spectroscopy**, **X-ray spectroscopy**, and **nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)**.

Our research is centered on developing and applying advanced algorithms, including artificial intelligence, theoretical chemistry, and computational physics, to explore **the intricate relationship between spectral features and microscopic structure**. 

We aim to gain deeper insights into the molecular structures at complex interfaces, advancing knowledge in **materials science**, **water science**, **electrochemistry**, and related fields.


**Research Topics**

 * Water under the Complicated Interfaces:

 * Material under the Extreme Condition:

 * Spectroscopic Properties of Battery Materials:
