I was trained as a computational physicist. I am interested in applying theoretical numerical calculation to solve the physical/chemical problems. I am now especially using the molecular dynamics simulation techniques, ab initio calculation method together with experimental spectroscopies, such as sum frequency generation spectroscopy (SFG) and X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) to understand the structures and dynamics of liquid water, ice, TiO2 interface, and organic materials etc.
