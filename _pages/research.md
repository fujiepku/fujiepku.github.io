I am trained as a **computational physicist** with a strong interest for applying theoretical and numerical methods to solve **complex physical and chemical problems**.

My research group focuses on utilizing molecular dynamics simulations and ab initio calculations, integrated with multimodal spectroscopic techniques such as **vibrational spectroscopy (IR, Raman, SFG)**, **excited-state spectroscopy**, **X-ray spectroscopy**, and **nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)**.

Our work revolves around developing and applying cutting-edge algorithms—including artificial intelligence, theoretical chemistry, and computational physics—to investigate **the intricate relationship between spectral features and microscopic structures**.

Through our research, we aim to advance understanding of molecular structures at complex interfaces, contributing to key fields such as **materials science**, **water science**, **electrochemistry**, and related fields.

**Research Topics**

* Water at Interfaces

* Materials under Extreme Conditions

* Spectroscopic Properties of Battery Materials
