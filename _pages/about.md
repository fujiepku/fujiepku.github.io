Since October 2018, I am an **Postdoc Fellow** in the [Prof. Xifan Wu's group](https://astro.temple.edu/~xifanwu/WuGroup.html) at [Department of Physics, Temple University](https://phys.cst.temple.edu/), Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA, working on the **X-ray absorption spectroscopy of water**.

**March 6, 2020**

My work at [Max Planck Institute for Polymer Research](https://www.mpip-mainz.mpg.de/en/home) is now published online in **Chemical Reviews**. We present an overview of the different simulation protocols available for SFG spectra calculations, revealing the advantages and disadvantages of the different methods. Furthermore, we account for the findings through combined SFG experiments and simulations and provide future challenges for SFG experiments and simulations at different aqueous interfaces.

**March 2, 2020**

My work at Temple University is now published online in **Physical Review Materials**. We found that the ferroelectricity of the molecular crystal could be probed by x-ray absorption spectroscopy. This approach should be generally applicable to the new series of organic ferroelectric and antiferroelectric materials.

I gave a talk in the CSI Bi-monthly seminar at Temple University. It is about "Molecular Modelling of the Interfacial Water at Water-Air Interface and Ice-Air Interface". Final remark comes for my PhD work.



**July 19, 2019**

I was invited to give a talk in Prof. Arun Majumdar's group at Department of Mechanical Engineering of Stanford University. It is about "Molecular Modelling of the Interfacial Water at Water-Air Interface and Ice-Air Interface". It is always happy to share my work to others. 



**July 3, 2019**

I'm pleased to announce that my thesis "Structures and Dynamics of Interfacial Water" has been selected for a **Springer Thesis Award** and has be published by **Springer**.
