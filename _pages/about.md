Our group is a part of [The Laboratory of AI for Electrochemistry (AI4EC lab)](https://ai4ec.ikkem.com/). 

Our research group specializes in **multimodal spectroscopic computational simulations of complex interfaces**. We focus on developing and applying advanced algorithms, including artificial intelligence, theortical chemistry and computational physics, to investigate **the intricate relationship between spectral features and microscopic structure**. 

We aim to provide deeper insights into the microscopic structures at complex interfaces, contributing to advancements in **materials science**, **water science**, **electrochemistry** and related fields.

My latest work at Xiamen University is now published online in **Angew. Chem. Int. Ed.**. In this work, By using surface-specific HD-SFG vibrational spectroscopy, we examine water molecular structure at a freely suspended graphene/water interface, finding that the SFG response mainly arises from the topmost 1–2 water layers, with minimal contribution from the graphene itself. Graphene weakly interacts with the interfacial water by lowering the vibrational frequency of the dangling O−H group, with a very slight impact on the hydrogen-bonded O−H group.

I gave an invited talk in the APS March Meeting at Minneapolis. It is about " Many-body effects in the X-ray absorption spectra of liquid water".

My latest work at Temple University is now published online in **Journal of Chemical Physics**. In this work, we have successfully extended our GW-BSE apporach to the NaCl solution. The observed changes in the XAS features of the NaCl solution, compared to those of pure water, are in good agreement between experimental and theoretical results. We provided detailed explanations for these spectral changes that occur when NaCl is solvated in pure water. Specifically, the presence of solvating ion pairs leads to localization of electron-hole excitons.
