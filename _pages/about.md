Since October 2018, I am a **Postdoc Fellow** in the [Prof. Xifan Wu's group](https://sites.temple.edu/xifanwu/) at [Department of Physics, Temple University](https://phys.cst.temple.edu/), Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA, working on the topics of **ab initio modeling of water and theoretical spectroscopy calculations**. 

Before that, I obtained my Ph.D in Physics under the supervision of [Prof. Limei Xu](https://xulm.pku.edu.cn/index.htm) from [International Center For Quantum Materials](http://icqm.pku.edu.cn/) in [Peking University](https://www.pku.edu.cn/) in 2018. During my Ph.D study, I visited [Dr. Yuki Nagata's group](https://asunaroyuki.wixsite.com/sstgroup) in [Prof. Mischa Bonn's department](https://www.mpip-mainz.mpg.de/en/bonn) in [Max Planck Institute for Polymer Research](https://www.mpip-mainz.mpg.de/en/home).

**Student recruitment 招生**: I am looking for motivated PhD, postdoc, and research assistant/undergraduate intern in my group and [**嘉庚创新实验室**](http://www.ikkem.com/)与**北京科学智能研究院（AISI）**联合创立的[**人工智能电化学联合实验室**(AI4EC lab)](http://www.ikkem.com/newsshow3.php?cid=43&id=926).

**Nov. 1, 2023**

My latest work at Temple University is now published online in **Journal of Chemical Physics**. In this work, we have successfully extended our GW-BSE apporach to the NaCl solution. The observed changes in the XAS features of the NaCl solution, compared to those of pure water, are in good agreement between experimental and theoretical results. We provided detailed explanations for these spectral changes that occur when NaCl is solvated in pure water. Specifically, the presence of solvating ion pairs leads to localization of electron-hole excitons.

My latest work at Temple University is now published online in **Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A.**. In this work, we solved a long-last controversial debate, whether the local structure of water is tetrahedral or not. In X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS), an electron–hole excitation probes the local atomic environment. The interpretation of the spectra requires challenging theoretical calculations. We report a first-principles calculation of the XAS of water that avoids the approximations of prior work. The calculated XAS spectra, and their variation with changes of temperature and/or with isotope substitution, are in good quantitative agreement with experiments. The emerging picture of the water structure is fully consistent with the conventional tetrahedral model.

My work at [Max Planck Institute for Polymer Research](https://www.mpip-mainz.mpg.de/en/home) is now published online in **Chemical Reviews**. We present an overview of the different simulation protocols available for sum-frequency generation (SFG) spectra calculations, revealing the advantages and disadvantages of the different methods. Furthermore, we account for the findings through combined SFG experiments and simulations, provide future challenges for SFG experiments and simulations at different aqueous interfaces.

My work at Temple University is now published online in **Physical Review Materials**. We found that the ferroelectricity of the molecular crystal could be probed by X-ray absorption spectroscopy. This approach should be generally applicable to the new series of organic ferroelectric and antiferroelectric materials.
