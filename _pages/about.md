Since January 2024, I am an **Associate Professor** in the [Pen-Tung Sah Institute of Micro-Nano Science and Technology](https://sbd.xmu.edu.cn/info/1096/8589.htm) at [Xiamen University](https://www.xmu.edu.cn/) and I hold a joint appointment as **Associate Researcher** in the [Laboratory of AI for Electrochemistry (AI4EC Lab)](https://ai4ec.ikkem.com/), Xiamen, Fujian, China.


Before that, I was a Postdoc Fellow in the [Prof. Xifan Wu's group](https://sites.temple.edu/xifanwu/) at [Department of Physics, Temple University](https://phys.cst.temple.edu/), Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA, working on the topics of ab initio modeling of water and theoretical spectroscopy calculations from 2018 to 2023.

I obtained my Ph.D in Physics under the supervision of [Prof. Limei Xu](https://xulm.pku.edu.cn/index.htm) from [International Center For Quantum Materials](http://icqm.pku.edu.cn/) in [Peking University](https://www.pku.edu.cn/) in 2018. During my Ph.D study, I visited [Dr. Yuki Nagata's group](https://asunaroyuki.wixsite.com/sstgroup) in [Prof. Mischa Bonn's department](https://www.mpip-mainz.mpg.de/en/bonn) in [Max Planck Institute for Polymer Research](https://www.mpip-mainz.mpg.de/en/home).


**Student recruitment 招生**: I am looking for motivated PhD, postdoc, and research assistant/undergraduate intern in my group and [**嘉庚创新实验室**](http://www.ikkem.com/)与[**北京科学智能研究院（AISI）**](https://www.aisi.ac.cn/)联合创立的[**人工智能电化学联合实验室**(AI4EC lab)](http://www.ikkem.com/newsshow3.php?cid=43&id=926). Feel free to contact me if you are interested.

**Researcher recruitment 研究员/工程师岗位(人工智能电化学联合实验室)**： We also have openings for full time/intern researcher/engineer at AI4EC lab. Feel free to contact me if you are interested.

I gave an invited talk in the APS March Meeting at Minneapolis. It is about " Many-body effects in the X-ray absorption spectra of liquid water".



**Nov. 1, 2023**

My latest work at Temple University is now published online in **Journal of Chemical Physics**. In this work, we have successfully extended our GW-BSE apporach to the NaCl solution. The observed changes in the XAS features of the NaCl solution, compared to those of pure water, are in good agreement between experimental and theoretical results. We provided detailed explanations for these spectral changes that occur when NaCl is solvated in pure water. Specifically, the presence of solvating ion pairs leads to localization of electron-hole excitons.
