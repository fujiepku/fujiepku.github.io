Our new collaborating work with the experimental collegues from [Prof. Mischa Bonn's department](https://www.mpip-mainz.mpg.de/en/bonn) in [Max Planck Institute for Polymer Research](https://www.mpip-mainz.mpg.de/en/home) is finally accepted in **Nature Communications**. 

Water plays a crucial role in geological, biological, and technological processes. Nanoscale water confinement occurs in many of these settings, including sedimentary rocks, water channel proteins, and applications like desalination and water purification membranes. The structure and properties of water in nanoconfinement can differ significantly from bulk water, exhibiting, for instance, modified hydrogen bonds, dielectric constant, and phase transitions. Despite the importance of strongly nanoconfined water, experimentally elucidating the nanoconfinement effects on water, such as its orientation and hydrogen bond (H-bond) network, has remained challenging. Here, we study two-dimensionally nanoconfined aqueous electrolyte solutions with tunable confinement from nanoscale to angstrom-scale sandwiched between a graphene sheet and CaF2 achieved by capillary condensation. We employ heterodyne-detection sum-frequency generation (HD-SFG) spectroscopy, a surface-specific vibrationalspectroscopy capable of directly and selectively probing water orientation and H-bond environment at interfaces and under confinement. Remarkably, the vibrational spectra of the nanoconfined water can be described quantitatively by the sum of the individual water surface signals from the CaF2/water and water/graphene interfaces until the confinement reduces to angstrom-scale (< ~8 Å).Machine-learning-accelerated ab initio molecular dynamics simulations confirm our experimental observation. These results manifest that interfacial, rather than nanoconfinement effects, dominate the water structure until angstrom-level confinement for the two-dimensionally nanoconfined water.

Our new work at Xiamen University is now published online in **Journal of the American Chemical Society**. 

In this work, we propose a machine learning-based approach to predict dynamic $^7$Li NMR chemical shifts in LiFSI/DME electrolyte solutions. Additionally, we provide a comprehensive structural analysis to interpret the observed chemical shift behavior in experiments, particularly the abrupt changes in $^7$Li chemical shifts at high concentrations. Using advanced modeling techniques, we quantitatively establish the relationship between molecular structure and NMR spectrum, offering critical insights into solvation structure assignments. Our findings reveal the coexistence of two competing local solvation structures that shift in dominance as electrolyte concentration approaches the concentrated limit, leading to an anomalous reverse of $^7$Li NMR chemical shift in the experiment. This work provides a detailed molecular-level understanding of the intricate solvation structures probed by NMR spectroscopy, leading the way for enhanced electrolyte design.

Our new work at Xiamen University is now published online in **Nature Computational Science**.

In this work, we introduce NMRNet, a deep learning framework using the SE(3) Transformer for atomic environment modeling, following a pretraining and fine-tuning paradigm. To support the evaluation of nuclear magnetic resonance chemical shift prediction models, we have established a comprehensive benchmark based on previous research and databases, covering diverse chemical systems. Applying NMRNet to these benchmark datasets, we achieve competitive performance in both liquid-state and solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance datasets, demonstrating its robustness and practical utility in real-world scenarios. Our work helps to advance deep learning applications in analytical and structural chemistry.

My last work at Temple University is now published online in **Physical Review X**. It is also featured news in Viewpoint in **Physics Magazine** ["Shedding Light on Water Wires"](https://physics.aps.org/articles/v18/54) by [Prof. Davide Donadio](https://physics.aps.org/authors/davide_donadio) and [Prof. Giulia Galli](https://physics.aps.org/authors/giulia_galli). 

In this work, by combining molecular-dynamics simulations and calculations of optical spectra based on many-body perturbation theory, we identified a clear spectroscopic fingerprint of molecular wires. Specifically, we showed that the “charge-transfer exciton” peak at ~8 eV in the UV absorption spectrum of water stems from collective excitations in hydrogen-bonded water wires. A charge-transfer exciton is a special type of electronic excitation, where an electron on one water molecule interacts with a positively charged “hole” localized on another molecule. The strength of the hydrogen bond directly influences the degree of charge transfer between molecules, with stronger hydrogen bonds facilitating greater charge separation and providing stronger optical absorption.

My first work as last author at Xiamen University is now published online in **J. Chem. Phys.**.  In this work, we present a pathway for calculating vibrational spectra (IR, Raman, SFG) of solid-water interfaces using machine learning (ML)-accelerated methods. We employ both the dipole moment-polarizability correlation function and the surface-specific velocity-velocity correlation function approaches to calculate SFG spectra. Our results demonstrate the successful acceleration of AIMD simulations and the calculation of SFG spectra using ML methods. This advancement provides an opportunity to calculate SFG spectra for the complicated solid-water systems more rapidly and at a lower computational cost with the aid of ML.

Our paper is in the special collection: "**Festschrift in honor of Yuen-Ron Shen**", and highlighted as **JCP Editor's Pick**.

My work at Xiamen University is now published online in **Angew. Chem. Int. Ed.**. In this work, we developed a machine learning spectroscopic methods, together with experimental collegues from [Prof. Mischa Bonn's department](https://www.mpip-mainz.mpg.de/en/bonn) in [Max Planck Institute for Polymer Research](https://www.mpip-mainz.mpg.de/en/home), examined water molecular structure at a freely suspended graphene/water interface, finding that the SFG response mainly arises from the topmost 1–2 water layers, with minimal contribution from the graphene itself. Graphene weakly interacts with the interfacial water by lowering the vibrational frequency of the dangling O−H group, with a very slight impact on the hydrogen-bonded O−H group.
