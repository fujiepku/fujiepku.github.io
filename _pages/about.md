Since October 2018, I am a **Postdoc Fellow** in the [Prof. Xifan Wu's group](https://sites.temple.edu/xifanwu/) at [Department of Physics, Temple University](https://phys.cst.temple.edu/), Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA, working on the topics of **ab initio modeling of water and theoretical spectroscopy calculations**.

**Dec. 02, 2022**

I gave a talk in the CSI Bi-monthly Online Seminar at Princeton CSI Center. The title is "Molecular insights into optical spectroscopy of liquid water and ice". 



**Aug. 14, 2022**

I'm pleased to announce that two different book chapters I wrote are online. 

** First chapter is with Takakazu Seki, Chun-Chieh Yu and Yuki Nagata. Title is "Microscopic Structure of Ice Surface Viewed through Sum-frequency Generation Spectroscopy", chapter 3 of "Chemistry of the Cryosphere", Advances in Atmospheric Chemistry, Vol. 3, by World Scientific Publishing.

** Second chapter is with Xifan. Title is "Theoretical X-ray Absorption Spectroscopy of Liquid Water Using First Principles Calculations", chapter 1 of "Properties of Water from Numerical and Experimental Perspectives" by CRC Press.

My latest work at Temple University is now published online in **Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A.**. In this work, we solved a long-last controversial debate, whether the local structure of water is tetrahedral or not. In X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS), an electron–hole excitation probes the local atomic environment. The interpretation of the spectra requires challenging theoretical calculations. We report a first-principles calculation of the XAS of water that avoids the approximations of prior work. The calculated XAS spectra, and their variation with changes of temperature and/or with isotope substitution, are in good quantitative agreement with experiments. The emerging picture of the water structure is fully consistent with the conventional tetrahedral model.

I gave a talk in the 2022 APS March Meeting. It is about "First-Principles Calculations of Optical Spectra in Liquid Water using GW plus Bethe-Salpeter Equation approach".

My work at Temple University is now published online in **Physical Review B**. Our study indicates that NQEs plays a small but non-negligible role in predicting the electronic structure of the aqueous solvation of ions of the Hofmeister series.

**Mar. 6, 2020**

My work at [Max Planck Institute for Polymer Research](https://www.mpip-mainz.mpg.de/en/home) is now published online in **Chemical Reviews**. We present an overview of the different simulation protocols available for sum-frequency generation (SFG) spectra calculations, revealing the advantages and disadvantages of the different methods. Furthermore, we account for the findings through combined SFG experiments and simulations, provide future challenges for SFG experiments and simulations at different aqueous interfaces.

My work at Temple University is now published online in **Physical Review Materials**. We found that the ferroelectricity of the molecular crystal could be probed by X-ray absorption spectroscopy. This approach should be generally applicable to the new series of organic ferroelectric and antiferroelectric materials.

**Dec. 13, 2019**

I gave a talk in the CSI Bi-monthly seminar at Temple University. It is about "Molecular Modelling of the Interfacial Water at Water-Air Interface and Ice-Air Interface". Final remark comes for my PhD work.


**Jul. 19, 2019**

I was invited to give a talk in Prof. Arun Majumdar's group at Department of Mechanical Engineering of Stanford University. It is about "Molecular Modelling of the Interfacial Water at Water-Air Interface and Ice-Air Interface". It is always happy to share my work to others. 


**Jul. 3, 2019**

I'm pleased to announce that my thesis "Structures and Dynamics of Interfacial Water" has been selected for a **Springer Thesis Award** and has be published by **Springer**.
