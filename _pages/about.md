Since October 2018, I am a **Postdoc Fellow** in the [Prof. Xifan Wu's group](https://sites.temple.edu/xifanwu/) at [Department of Physics, Temple University](https://phys.cst.temple.edu/), Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA, working on the topics of **ab initio modeling of water and theoretical spectroscopy calculations**.

**May 20, 2021**

I'm pleased to announce that two different book chapter I wrote will be avaiable soon. First one with Takakazu Seki, Chun-Chieh Yu, Yuki Nagata. Title is "Microscopic Structure of Ice Surface Viewed through Sum-frequency Generation Spectroscopy", in a Chapter of "Chemistry of the Cryosphere", Advances in Atmospheric Chemistry, Vol. 3, by World Scientific Publishing. Second one is with Xifan, title is "Theoretical X-ray Absorption Spectroscopy of Liquid Water Using First Principles Calculations", in a chapter of "Properties of Water from Numerical and Experimental Perspectives" by CRC Press. 


**April 30, 2021**

I gave a talk in the CSI Bi-monthly Online seminar. It is about "Theoretical X-ray Absorption Spectroscopy of Liquid Water by the GW plus Bethe-Salpeter equation (GW-BSE) method".

I gave a talk in the APS March Online Meeting. It is about "Theoretical X-ray Absorption Spectroscopy of Liquid Water by the GW plus Bethe-Salpeter equation (GW-BSE) method".

My work at [Max Planck Institute for Polymer Research](https://www.mpip-mainz.mpg.de/en/home) is now published online in **Chemical Reviews**. We present an overview of the different simulation protocols available for sum-frequency generation (SFG) spectra calculations, revealing the advantages and disadvantages of the different methods. Furthermore, we account for the findings through combined SFG experiments and simulations, provide future challenges for SFG experiments and simulations at different aqueous interfaces.

**March 2, 2020**

My work at Temple University is now published online in **Physical Review Materials**. We found that the ferroelectricity of the molecular crystal could be probed by X-ray absorption spectroscopy. This approach should be generally applicable to the new series of organic ferroelectric and antiferroelectric materials.

**Dec. 13, 2019**

I gave a talk in the CSI Bi-monthly seminar at Temple University. It is about "Molecular Modelling of the Interfacial Water at Water-Air Interface and Ice-Air Interface". Final remark comes for my PhD work.



**July 19, 2019**

I was invited to give a talk in Prof. Arun Majumdar's group at Department of Mechanical Engineering of Stanford University. It is about "Molecular Modelling of the Interfacial Water at Water-Air Interface and Ice-Air Interface". It is always happy to share my work to others. 



**July 3, 2019**

I'm pleased to announce that my thesis "Structures and Dynamics of Interfacial Water" has been selected for a **Springer Thesis Award** and has be published by **Springer**.
