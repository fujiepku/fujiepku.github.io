Our group is a part of [The Laboratory of AI for Electrochemistry (AI4EC lab)](https://ai4ec.ikkem.com/). 

Our research group specializes in **multimodal spectroscopic computational simulations of complex interfaces**. We focus on developing and applying advanced algorithms, including artificial intelligence, theortical chemistry and computational physics, to investigate **the intricate relationship between spectral features and microscopic structure**. 

We aim to provide deeper insights into the microscopic structures at complex interfaces, contributing to advancements in **materials science**, **water science**, **electrochemistry** and related fields.

My latest work at Xiamen University is now published online in **Angew. Chem. Int. Ed.**. In this work, we developed aa machine learning spectroscopic methods, together with experimental collegues from [Prof. Mischa Bonn's department](https://www.mpip-mainz.mpg.de/en/bonn) in [Max Planck Institute for Polymer Research](https://www.mpip-mainz.mpg.de/en/home), examined water molecular structure at a freely suspended graphene/water interface, finding that the SFG response mainly arises from the topmost 1–2 water layers, with minimal contribution from the graphene itself. Graphene weakly interacts with the interfacial water by lowering the vibrational frequency of the dangling O−H group, with a very slight impact on the hydrogen-bonded O−H group.
