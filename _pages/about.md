My last work at Temple University is now published online in **Physical Review X**. It is also featured news in Viewpoint in **Physics Magazine** ["Shedding Light on Water Wires"](https://physics.aps.org/articles/v18/54) by [Prof. Davide Donadio](https://physics.aps.org/authors/davide_donadio) and [Prof. Giulia Galli](https://physics.aps.org/authors/giulia_galli). 

In this work, by combining molecular-dynamics simulations and calculations of optical spectra based on many-body perturbation theory, we identified a clear spectroscopic fingerprint of molecular wires. Specifically, they showed that the “charge-transfer exciton” peak at ~8 eV in the UV absorption spectrum of water stems from collective excitations in hydrogen-bonded water wires. A charge-transfer exciton is a special type of electronic excitation, where an electron on one water molecule interacts with a positively charged “hole” localized on another molecule. The strength of the hydrogen bond directly influences the degree of charge transfer between molecules, with stronger hydrogen bonds facilitating greater charge separation and providing stronger optical absorption.

My first work as last author at Xiamen University is now published online in **J. Chem. Phys.**.  In this work, we present a pathway for calculating vibrational spectra (IR, Raman, SFG) of solid-water interfaces using machine learning (ML)-accelerated methods. We employ both the dipole moment-polarizability correlation function and the surface-specific velocity-velocity correlation function approaches to calculate SFG spectra. Our results demonstrate the successful acceleration of AIMD simulations and the calculation of SFG spectra using ML methods. This advancement provides an opportunity to calculate SFG spectra for the complicated solid-water systems more rapidly and at a lower computational cost with the aid of ML.

Our paper is in the special collection: "**Festschrift in honor of Yuen-Ron Shen**", and highlighted as **JCP Editor's Pick**.

My work at Xiamen University is now published online in **Angew. Chem. Int. Ed.**. In this work, we developed a machine learning spectroscopic methods, together with experimental collegues from [Prof. Mischa Bonn's department](https://www.mpip-mainz.mpg.de/en/bonn) in [Max Planck Institute for Polymer Research](https://www.mpip-mainz.mpg.de/en/home), examined water molecular structure at a freely suspended graphene/water interface, finding that the SFG response mainly arises from the topmost 1–2 water layers, with minimal contribution from the graphene itself. Graphene weakly interacts with the interfacial water by lowering the vibrational frequency of the dangling O−H group, with a very slight impact on the hydrogen-bonded O−H group.
